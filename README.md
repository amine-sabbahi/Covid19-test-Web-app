## Introduction
The emergence of COVID-19 in March 2019 brought about a global health crisis. This project aims to provide a solution to rapidly and accurately detect COVID-19 using deep learning algorithms applied to X-ray images.

## Problem Statement
PCR tests, though accurate, are expensive and time-consuming. This project addresses the need for a faster and cost-effective method to detect COVID-19, using deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a CNN-based model to detect COVID-19 from X-ray images and deploy this model in a web application using the Flask framework.

## Importance of AI
Artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, has shown significant potential in medical imaging. This project leverages AI to enhance the accuracy and speed of COVID-19 detection, which is crucial in controlling the spread of the virus.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project, problem statement, and objectives.
2. **General Information on AI**: Basics of artificial intelligence and deep learning.
3. **Implementation of the Base Model**: Development and training of the CNN model.
4. **Results and Web Application Deployment**: Evaluation of the model and deployment in a web application.
5. **Conclusion and Future Work**: Summary of the project and potential future enhancements.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/amine-sabbahi/Covid19-test-Web-app.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Covid19-test-Web-app
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
5. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. To start the web application, run:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
2. Access the web application at `http://localhost:5000`.



## Results
The model achieved significant accuracy in detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images. Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the `results` folder.
